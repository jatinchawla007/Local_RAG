Widely accepted as the best single authoritative text and reference on electronic circuit design, both analog and digital, the ﬁrst two editions were translated into eight languages, and sold more than a million copies worldwide. The art of electronics is explained by stressing the methods actually used by circuit designers – a combination of some basic laws, rules of thumb, and a nonmathematical treatment that encourages understanding why and how a circuit works. Paul Horowitz is a Research Professor of Physics and of Electrical Engineering at Harvard University, where in 1974 he originated the Laboratory Electronics course from which emerged The Art of Electronics. In addition to his work in circuit design and electronic instrumentation, his research interests have included observational astrophysics, x-ray and particle microscopy, and optical interferometry. He is one of the pioneers of the search for intelligent life beyond Earth (SETI). He is the author of some 200 scientiﬁc articles and reports, has consulted widely for industry and government, and is the designer of numerous scientiﬁc and photographic instruments. Winﬁeld Hill is by inclination an electronics circuit-design guru. After dropping out of the Chemical Physics graduate program at Harvard University, and obtaining an E.E. degree, he began his engineering career at Harvard’s Electronics Design Center. After 7 years of learning electronics at Harvard he founded Sea Data Corporation, where he spent 16 years designing instruments for Physical Oceanography. In 1988 he was recruited by Edwin Land to join the Rowland Institute for Science. The institute subsequently merged with Harvard University in 2003. As director of the institute’s Electronics Engineering Lab he has designed some 500 scientiﬁc instruments. Recent interests include high-voltage RF (to 15 kV), high-current pulsed electronics (to 1200 A), low-noise ampliﬁers (to sub-nV and pA), and MOSFET pulse generators.'}]"

You might begin with a value of R4 somewhere in the range of 10% to 20% of R3. D. Loop damping and jitter A side effect of the nonzero “damping” resistor R4 is the creation of some jitter in the PLL output. An easy way to see this is to realize that even at high frequencies the loop ﬁlter permits a fraction R4/(R3 + R4) of the raw phase- detector output to reach the VCO. For typical ratios, R3 ≈ 10R4, this can add substantial jitter to the VCO output. The usual solution is to add a small capacitor (∼ C2/20) from the VCO control input to ground, preferably close to the VCO pin to ﬁlter any other high-frequency noise as well. E. PLL real-world design We sailed through this design example, having faith that the information in the datasheets for the IC we chose (the popular ’HC4046) was reliable. That faith was, perhaps, a bit misplaced. To give this cautionary section some con- text, here’s the story (the short version) of our oscillator component choices in Figure 13.99: We wanted a 3× safety margin for our 61 kHz center frequency, so we set fmin=20 kHz and fmax=200 kHz. We chose TI’s CD74HC4046A because it was RCA’s origi- nal time-proven design. Based on the datasheet’s graphs, a good value for the timing capacitor C1 was 1000 pF. For the timing resistors one of us started with the R1 plots and came up with 30k and 300k for R1 and R2, and we edited the ﬁgure accordingly. The other author started with the R2 plot (as suggested by two manufacturers, but it should not have mattered) and came up with 40 k and 410 k. Wor- ried about these and other inconsistencies (e.g., one spec in the TI datasheet gives fosc=400 kHz, typ, for C1=1 nF and R2=220k, while their Figure 27 suggests it should be more like 33 kHz), we went to the bench and found actual val- ues of 45k and 482k for the desired frequency range. The values we chose initially would have worked, despite the factor of 1.5 deviation from reality, but they would have used up half of our 3× safety margin.120 So, what’s going on here? Each of the ’HC4046 manu- 120 We made additional bench measurements on both old and new 74HC4046A parts from TI, NXP, ON Semi, and Fairchild. We found good self-consistency within any single manufacturers parts; the vari- ations in span and zero frequency within a batch and over a 15-year period were generally under 5%. Measured frequencies for the NXP, ON Semi, and Fairchild parts deviated by +5%, +160%, and −60%, respectively, from that of the TI parts, when conﬁgured with the timing component values shown in Figure 13.99. facturers uses a different circuit for their VCO design.121 Although intended to be predictable and linear, in practice the VCO control is nonlinear, and its parameters vary with control current, supply voltage, and operating frequency, especially above 10 MHz. Although you can ﬁnd analyt- ical expressions for the VCO’s frequency (ON Semi app note AN1410), the recommended method is still to start with the timing component values (R1, R2, and C1) from datasheet graphs; then the designer is sternly admonished to adjust and validate those values with careful bench mea- surements before committing to manufacturing. This sort of variability and lack of conﬁdent predictabil- ity leads us to render this advice: (1) choose one manufacturer for your production design, and do not allow substitutes; (2) choose a wide safety margin for fmin and fmax, such as the 3× factor in our Figure 13.99; (3) replace your initial paper calculations with measured bench values for production. Rule (1) applies to any linear functionality in a logic IC, e.g., mixed-signal functions such as phase comparators, oscillators, VCOs, mixers, Schmitt triggers, monostables, or comparators. 13.13.5 PLL capture and lock Once locked, it is clear that a PLL will stay locked as long as the input frequency doesn’t wander outside the range of the feedback signal and doesn’t change more rapidly than the loop’s bandwidth can track. An interesting question to ask is how PLLs get locked in the ﬁrst place. After all, an initial frequency error results in a periodic output from the phase detector at the difference frequency. After ﬁltering by the lowpass ﬁlter, it is reduced to small-amplitude wig- gles rather than to a nice clean dc error signal. A. Capture transient The answer is a little complicated. First-order loops will always lock, because there is no lowpass attenuation of the error signal. Second-order loops may or may not lock, de- pending on the type of phase detector and the bandpass of the lowpass ﬁlter. In addition, the exclusive-OR (type I) phase detector has a limited capture range that depends on the ﬁlter time constant (this fact can be used to advantage 121 For example, TI biases R2 from VDD−0.7 V, whereas ON Semi biases it from VDD/3. Their current mirrors have nominal gains of 7.5 and 25 respectively. We think NXP’s 74HCT9046 is arguably the best man- nered ’4046 part available, and the NXP datasheets have better graphs.'},\n",

However, all is not roses: the rapid switching process generates transients at the switch- ing frequency and its harmonics, and these can be ex- tremely difﬁcult to ﬁlter effectively. We’ll discuss this soon enough. . . but it’s worth taking a look now at Figure 9.53, where the bad stuff on the outputs of two 5 V power sup- plies are compared.

D. Expanded trace of a single induced pulse, showing ringing at ∼15 MHz. 9.6 Switching regulators and dc–dc converters 9.6.1 Linear versus switching All the voltage-regulator circuits we have discussed so far work the same way: a linear control element (the “pass transistor”) in series with the dc input is used, with feed- back, to maintain constant output voltage (or perhaps con- stant current).51 The output voltage is always lower in volt- age than the input voltage, and signiﬁcant power is dissi- pated in the control element, namely Pdiss=Iout(Vin−Vout). As we’ve seen, the dc input to a linear regulator may be simply another (higher) regulated dc voltage within the system; or it may be unregulated dc that is derived from the 51 A minor variation on this theme is the shunt regulator, in which the control element is tied from the output to ground, rather than in series with the load; the simple resistor-plus-zener is an example. Figure 9.54. Averaged frequency spectrum of the switching power supply of Figure 9.53, showing the dithered ∼50 kHz switching fre- quency and its harmonics. powerline, via the by-now familiar transformer–rectiﬁer– capacitor circuit. Let’s look a bit more at the issue of efﬁciency. Power supplies with linear regulators are necessarily inefﬁcient, because the pass transistor carries the full load current, and it must have enough voltage drop to accommodate a worst-case combination of input ripple and low line volt- age. The situation is exacerbated for low-output-voltage supplies: for example, a linear regulator to deliver +3.3 V at 10 A would use an unregulated dc voltage of perhaps +6 V to ensure adequate headroom; so you’ve got 27 W of pass-transistor dissipation while delivering 33 W to the load – that’s 55% efﬁciency. You may not care that much about efﬁciency per se; but the wasted power has to be dis- sipated, which means a large heatsink area, blowers, etc. If you were to scale up this example to 100 A, say, you would have a serious problem removing the quarter of a kilowatt (!) of pass-transistor heat. You would have to use multiple pass transistors and forced-air cooling. The supply would be heavy, noisy, and hot. There is another way to generate a regulated dc voltage (shown earlier in Figure 9.48B), which is fundamentally different from what we’ve seen so far – look at Figure 9.55. In this switching converter a transistor, operated as a satu- rated switch, periodically applies the full unregulated volt- age across an inductor for short intervals. The inductor’s current builds up during each pulse, storing 1 2LI2 of energy in its magnetic ﬁeld. When the switch is turned off, some'},\n",

Selecting low-noise JFETS 515 Bandwidth In the signal path, ampliﬁer U1 is a de- compensated low-noise (en∼3.5nV/ √ Hz typ at 10 Hz) wideband ( fT∼63 MHz) op-amp, here conﬁgured as an integrator with fT=5 MHz (33 pF and 1.0 kΩ). Its slew rate of 17 V/μs translates to a ﬁrst-stage output of 5 Vpp at the instrument’s rated 1 MHz bandwidth. In the sec- ond stage, capacitor C3 limits the bandwidth to ∼2 MHz. In the ﬁrst-stage bias path (which matters for common- mode rejection), integrator U2 has an output slew rate of 10 V/μs (min), so it can follow a 3 Vpp common-mode in- put (the instrument’s rated maximum) at the full 1 MHz rated bandwidth. The integrator’s unity-gain bandwidth is 230 kHz (6.8 pF and 50 kΩ), thus a bias-setting loop gain of 230 at 1 kHz. That puts an increasing CMRR burden on U1 at higher frequencies, evident in the instrument’s CMRR speciﬁcation: > 90 dB to 1 kHz, decreasing by 6 dB/octave (i.e., as 1/f) above 1 kHz.64 Offset voltage These dual JFETs are not in the same league as precision-matched BJTs, and they don’t claim to be. The NPD5564 (the best grade in its family) has a speciﬁed maximum offset voltage (i.e., gate-source mis- match, |VGS1−VGS2|) of 5 mV at ID=2 mA; the LSK389B, though excelling in noise performance, is considerably poorer, with a maximum mismatch of 20 mV (speciﬁed at ID=1 mA). The SR560 deals with this problem by throw- ing pots at it: there’s a 10-turn OFFSET trimmer in Q1b’s drain, with enough range (±0.13 mA) to balance a worst- case offset, and a second 10-turn trimmer down in the source resistor string to independently balance the offset when switched to low gain. There is a pair of analogous CMRR trimmers, 20-turns each. We’ve done the calibra- tion routine (complete with some iteration of the not-very- orthogonal adjustments), and can attest to the fussiness of getting (and sustaining) deep offset and CMRR nulls. Noise voltage To minimize noise voltage, the JFETs are operated at relatively high current, and the resistor values (in the source, drain, and signal path generally) are intentionally small. With the original noise budget of ∼4nV/ √ Hz it was acceptable, for example, to use 110 Ω resistors in the JFET sources. But a series pair of that resistance produces a Johnson noise-voltage density of 2 nV/ √ Hz, a bit more than we’d like when paired with these quieter JFETs. An optimized design would reduce those values by perhaps a factor of 2. Miscellany Low-level signal switching (e.g., ac/dc/gnd 64 The high-frequency CMRR could likely be improved by conﬁguring U1’s output to control a pair of current-sink transistors biasing Q1ab. input coupling, ×1/×10 gain selection, and A/B input in- terchange) is done with electromechanical relays. Not just any old relay, though – these guys use relays with gold- cladded twin contacts (intended for stable low resistance, even with low-level signals where there is no contact clean- ing; see §1x.6.1). And these relays are the latching type, where a momentary pulse switches the state, thus elimi- nating noise-inducing coil currents in the steady state; this further eliminates local heating as a source of drift. In this instrument a microcontroller runs all relays and indicator lights, sensing a front-panel command (or external digi- tal control), and appropriately pulses relays as needed to change their state. 8.6.5 Selecting low-noise JFETS As we mentioned earlier, bipolar transistors offer the best noise performance with low source impedances, owing to their lower input-voltage noise. Voltage noise, en, is re- duced by choosing a transistor with low base resistance, rbb′, and operating at high collector current (as long as hFE remains high). For higher source impedances the current noise can be minimized instead by operating at lower col- lector current. At high values of source impedance, FETs are the best choices. Their voltage noise can be reduced by operating at higher drain currents, where the transconductance is high- est. FETs intended for low-noise applications have high κ values (see §3.1.4), which generally means high input ca- pacitance. For example, the low-noise 2SK170 has a typ- ical Ciss of 30 pF, whereas the PN4117–9 series of low- current FETs has a maximum Ciss of just 3 pF. Table 8.2 on the following page presents a selection of JFET candidates for low-noise circuits. It’s meant to be used in conjunction with Table 3.7, which has more exten- sive tabular data, including single-sample measurements. Also refer to Figure 3x.10’s transconductance plots, and Figure 8.52’s noise plots. The entries near the bottom of Table 8.2 are dual JFETs, suitable for differential stages; but note that their Vos is not impressive – generally far infe- rior to even the poorest op-amps (the interdigitated LS840, whose layout is shown in Figure 3.18, is the best of the lot, with 2 mV typical, 5 mV worst-case offset voltage). We favor JFETs with high transconductance and low gate-cutoff voltages, but sadly many of the old favorites with superior performance have been discontinued. NXP’s BF862 has become a “go-to” low-noise part, both quiet and with attractively low capacitance. Toshiba’s 2SK170 has been single-handedly kept in stock by large factory purchases by Mouser, and the second-source LSK170 is'}]"

Noise in transimpedance ampliﬁers Art of Electronics Third Edition gain-setting feedback resistor, it is stable.100 The input stage has a noise voltage density of en≈0.6nV/ √ Hz. The second op-amp (LT6230) is a wideband (200 MHz) low- noise (1.1 nV/ √ Hz) op-amp, powered by a low-noise ±5 V power supply101 (Figure 8.80D); with the JFET input stage, the combined GBW of these two stages is fT=gm/2πCc, or about 200 MHz with a Cc of 100 pF. The last stage has a gain of 50 and an fT of 65 MHz, boosting the composite ampliﬁer’s GBW to 10 GHz. When conﬁgured as a transimpedance ampliﬁer (i.e., Figures 8.80A and C), this circuit has 5× less noise voltage (thus 5× less enCin noise) than the composite TIA of Fig- ure 8.79. It also has greater bandwidth, thanks to its 20× higher fT, even with the larger value of feedback resistor (20M, chosen to reduce its Johnson-noise current, given the quieter front-end). Look ahead to Figure 8.81 to see this comparison graphically. Some details We measured en=0.35nV/ √ Hz for an IF3602 JFET operating at 10 mA, and 0.3nV/ √ Hz at 25 mA; here we chose the lower drain current of 10 mA for lower dissipation and reduced 1/f noise. Because of the IF3602’s very large capacitances (300 pF for Ciss, 200 pF for Crss) we clamped the drains with a cascode, set- ting VDS=VBE independently of VGS and input common- mode level. This further reduces JFET power dissipation (to about 6 mW each), and prevents excessive “impact- ionization” gate current (§3.2.8). The IF3602 pair is not well matched (speciﬁed Vos=100 mV max), which is especially troublesome in view of its very high transconductance (we measured gm=130 mS at 10 mA, see the plot of measured JFET transconductances in §3x.2). If we try to trim the offset by unbalancing the drain resistors (with a circuit like that of Figure 8.67), we quickly ﬁnd from ΔID/ID=0.5gmVos/ID that we need a 39% drain-current unbalance to null a worst- case input offset. Ouch! So we went with the scheme shown, in which a degenerated low-noise Wilson cur- rent mirror with selected ﬁxed trim resistors sets the re- quired unbalanced drain currents. The current mirror’s noise-voltage contribution with 100 Ω emitter resistors R4 and R5, when referred to the JFET input terminals, is en= \\x06 4kT/R4 · 1/gm, or 0.1 nV/ √ Hz, an insigniﬁcant 4% 100 With Cin=1000 pF, fRCin≈8 Hz and fT=10 GHz, so fGM≈280 kHz; a 0.032 pF effective capacitance across Rf makes fc=200 kHz. 101 Where we’ve started with an LT1027 reference, which uses a buried zener for low 1/ f noise, quieted further with a bypass capacitor at the noise-reduction pin. Adding a resistor to ground from the upper op- amp’s inverting input lets you change the quiet split-supply voltages, e.g., to ±6 V, or whatever. contribution when the squared amplitudes are combined. Finally, a comment on the differential pair current sink Q2: normally a differential pair’s current sink noise is not ter- ribly critical, because a reasonably well-balanced differen- tial stage cancels the noise (e.g., 30× for a 3% balance). But here we face a possibly severe current imbalance to trim the offset voltage, so we’ve used a low-noise voltage regulator (<10nV/ √ Hz), with further RC quieting of the current sink. Exercise 8.3. Calculate the noise densities of the ±5Q supplies in Figure 8.80D. What is their rms noise? B. Composite versus single-stage transimpedance ampliﬁers The plots of transimpedance gain and input noise current in Figure 8.81 are a good way to see the performance en- hancement you get with a composite TIA in the difﬁcult situation of high input capacitance. The improved perfor- mance comes from the greater ampliﬁer bandwidth fT, and from the ability to create a quiet input stage. Comparing ﬁrst the single-stage (i.e., not composite) conﬁgurations A and B, you see the improved bandwidth gained from the faster OPA637, with the tradeoff of greater noise. Adding a (composite) second stage to the quieter conﬁguration A gets you a lot of extra bandwidth with no increase of noise (conﬁguration C, the circuit of Fig- ure 8.78).

       "   'Because of the IF3602’s very large capacitances (300 pF for Ciss, 200 pF for Crss) we clamped the drains with a cascode, set- ting VDS=VBE independently of VGS and input common- mode level.',\n",

This summary reviews basic principles, facts, and application advice in Chapter 12. ¶A. Logic Interconnections. The subject of this chapter is the interconnection of digital logic signals and logic devices to. . . everything, where “ev- erything” includes (a) other logic devices, (b) input sources (switches, optoelectronics, cables), and (c) output devices (dc and ac power loads, optoelectonics, cables). So it’s a long chapter, rich with multiple themes. Here we try to or- ganize these diverse topics into manageable paragraphs. ¶B. Logic Families. §12.1.1. Contemporary digital logic is owned by CMOS, with the minor exception of some emitter-coupled logic families (ECL, PECL, and LVPECL) and some BiCMOS (ABT, BCT). CMOS inputs draw no current, and their logic thresholds are usually close to mid-supply, except for the -T sufﬁx types (HCT, ACT, AHCT, VHCT) where the threshold conforms to that of legacy bipolar TTL (∼1.4 V); see Figure 12.5. The 74HC[T] logic is good for easy prototyping and general-purpose use, and is available in DIP or SOIC; sub- stitute 74AC[T] or 74LV for applications needing higher speed. For lower-voltage applications at moderate speeds, use 74LVC or 74VCX (available in SOIC and mini-logic packages only). For operation up to 15 V you can use 4000B logic, but this stuff is slow. Finally, for differential signaling use LVDS (or LVPECL, if speciﬁed) drivers and receivers. See Figures 12.2 and 12.3 for logic-family speed versus power, and speed versus supply voltage. ¶C. Input and Output Characteristics. §§12.1.2A and 12.1.2B. CMOS inputs draw no current when 0V ≤ Vin ≤ VDD (and even for inputs a few tenths of a volt beyond). For most logic families, the input pro- tection diodes clamp to ground and VDD, thus causing sub- stantial input current for input voltages as much as a volt beyond VDD or below GND; this can cause SCR latchup. However, some families use zener-like clamping, allow- ing input swings well beyond the rail (and even when un- powered); examples include 5V-tolerant 74LVC, and 3.3V- tolerant 74AUP. See Figure 12.4. CMOS outputs swing to the rails, looking resistive for small load currents (Figure 12.7). The output current ca- pability varies widely among families; within a family it increases with increasing supply voltage. See Figure 12.6 for a summary of thresholds, and valid input and output voltage ranges. Note that the outputs of (essentially obso- lete) bipolar TTL logic (and also of digital ICs with nMOS outputs) do not saturate to the supply rail; see §12.4.5A. ¶D. Interfacing between Logic Families. You can mix logic types as long as you respect logic-level input requirements. At the basic level this means that (a) you can always make a direct connection between logic running at the same voltage; (b) logic running from a higher voltage (e.g., +5 V) can drive lower-voltage logic if the latter’s input is “tolerant”; and (c) lower-voltage logic can drive higher-voltage logic if the latter has “TTL thresh- olds” and the former is powered from at least +2.5 V. With dozens of logic families, most capable of operating over a range of supply voltages, you’ve got a lot of possibilities. Most are dealt with in §12.1.3, and presented pictorially in Figure 12.9. ¶E. Driving Digital Logic Inputs. §12.1.4. A mechanical switch with pullup (§12.1.4A) gen- erates the right logic levels, but with bounce. That may be OK for some applications; but for clean edges you need a debouncer, illustrated in a half-dozen variations in §12.1.4B. A logic input can come instead from a com- parator (a subject summarized in ¶G below, and treated in detail in §12.3), whose output may have active pullup to the same VDD as the driven logic, or it may come from an “open-drain” (or open-collector) terminal; in the latter case you need an external pullup to VDD. Figure 12.25 shows representative circuit conﬁgurations. When driving logic inputs from signals of any type, be careful not to overdrive the input (whether from a signal source of greater swing, or from transmission-line effects – see the egregious example in Figures 12.103 and 12.104); and do not leave unused logic inputs ﬂoating. Contemporary logic devices are engineered to withstand substantial static-electricity insults (deﬁned in terms of the human-body model, HBM, of 100 pF in series with 1.5kΩ, §12.1.5), but it’s best not to tempt fate; be careful to dis- charge yourself, use antistatic materials, etc. See also the earlier discussion in §3.5.4H. ¶F. Driving External Loads from Logic Outputs. §12.4. You can drive small loads (LEDs, SSRs, small me- chanical relays) directly from logic outputs (§12.4.1 and Figure 12.39), taking care to respect the output drive capa- bility (voltage swing, current), and, for a mechanical relay, adding a diode clamp across its coil. As shown in the ﬁgure, you can use an open-collector driver (ULN2003, 75468) to',\n",

LT1012 noise current versus time, for successive decade bandpasses. Vertical: 5 pA/div. Horizontal: scaled to band- pass, as indicated.10 Hz is only 3.5 times greater than that between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz; going down another six decades (to 10−12 Hz), the corresponding ratio grows only to 6.5. Put another way, the 1/f total noise power, going all the way down to a frequency that is the reciprocal of 32,000 years (when Neanderthals still roamed the planet, and there were no op-amps), is just six times greater than that of the usual datasheet 0.1–10 Hz “low-frequency noise.”So much for catastrophes. To ﬁnd out whether the low-frequency noise of real op- amps continues to conform to a 1/f spectrum, we mea- sured the current noise spectrum of an LT1012 op-amp all the way down to 0.5 millihertz,130 with the result of Fig- ure 8.107. As we remarked above, this op-amp is unusual in that its current noise density in rises faster than the usual 1/√ f (pink noise) for a decade around 1 Hz; but even so it settles back to the canonical pink noise, and ultimately be- comes something closer to “pale white” ( f −1/4 or slower). You could conclude that this demonstrates the unphys- ical nature of 1/f behavior all the way down to zero. But there’s another possible explanation, namely that this op- amp is afﬂicted with some mild burst noise. That would be consistent with the “faster-than-pink” slope around 1 Hz (recall the burst-noise spectrum in Figure 8.6), and it would also lead you to incorrectly attribute a “slower-than-pink” 130 We averaged 100 power spectra, accumulating a 2000-second time series for each one: not a quick experiment!1 10 100 1k 10k 0.1 10 100 1k Frequency (Hz) 0.001 0.01 LT1012 Current noise density, in (fA/√Hz) f -1/2 f -1 f -1/2 f -1/3 f -1/4 Figure 8.107. Measured LT1012 noise current spectrum, extend- ing down to 500 microhertz. Several slopes are shown, for your amusement.slope at the low frequency end of the spectrum in Fig- ure 8.107. If this latter explanation is correct, measurements at even lower frequencies (to 0.00001 Hz, say) would con- ﬁrm a continuing 1/f (pink) slope. But it takes a full day to reach 10 μHz, which is why reliable long time- scale data are hard to ﬁnd. An interesting datapoint is pro- vided by Daire’s measurement of the “Spectral Noise Dis- tribution” of a Keithley 6430 high sensitivity (0.05 fA res- olution) source-measure instrument,131 which displays a 1/f character all the way down to a microhertz (corre- sponding to a time scale of several weeks). With this in mind, it is quite possible that the low-frequency ﬂattening seen in Figure 8.107 is indeed an artifact of a burst-noise plateau. Or maybe not – there’s no statutory requirement that extremely-low-frequency noise must obey a 1/f (pink- noise) spectrum.8.13.5 Measuring the noise voltage There is a class of test instruments, called spectrum ana- lyzers or dynamic signal analyzers, that measure and dis- play the frequency spectrum of an input signal. One style is optimized for low-frequency and audio use, generally up to ∼100 kHz or so, with spectral calculations done with a discrete Fourier transform; examples are the Stanford Research Systems SR780/5 and the Agilent U8903A. At the other end you ﬁnd RF and microwave spectrum ana- lyzers whose upper frequency limits range from ∼3 GHz 131 Adam Daire, “Counting electrons: how to measure currents in the at- toampere range,” Keithley Instruments, Inc., September 2005.

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'The Art of Electronics Third Edition At long last, here is the thoroughly revised and updated, and long-anticipated, third edition of the hugely successful The Art of Electronics. Widely accepted as the best single authoritative text and reference on electronic circuit design, both analog and digital, the ﬁrst two editions were translated into eight languages, and sold more than a million copies worldwide. The art of electronics is explained by stressing the methods actually used by circuit designers – a combination of some basic laws, rules of thumb, and a nonmathematical treatment that encourages understanding why and how a circuit works. Paul Horowitz is a Research Professor of Physics and of Electrical Engineering at Harvard University, where in 1974 he originated the Laboratory Electronics course from which emerged The Art of Electronics. In addition to his work in circuit design and electronic instrumentation, his research interests have included observational astrophysics, x-ray and particle microscopy, and optical interferometry. He is one of the pioneers of the search for intelligent life beyond Earth (SETI). He is the author of some 200 scientiﬁc articles and reports, has consulted widely for industry and government, and is the designer of numerous scientiﬁc and photographic instruments. Winﬁeld Hill is by inclination an electronics circuit-design guru. After dropping out of the Chemical Physics graduate program at Harvard University, and obtaining an E. E. degree, he began his engineering career at Harvard’s Electronics Design Center. After 7 years of learning electronics at Harvard he founded Sea Data Corporation, where he spent 16 years designing instruments for Physical Oceanography. In 1988 he was recruited by Edwin Land to join the Rowland Institute for Science. The institute subsequently merged with Harvard University in 2003. As director of the institute’s Electronics Engineering Lab he has designed some 500 scientiﬁc instruments. Recent interests include high-voltage RF (to 15 kV), high-current pulsed electronics (to 1200 A), low-noise ampliﬁers (to sub-nV and pA), and MOSFET pulse generators.',\n",
